  <h2>FITT</h2>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>People want to do some exercise to keep healthy and beautiful, but for various reasons they don't do it. On the basis of offering different fitness lessons, Fitt combines " leaderboard" with "online shopping stores" to motivate people to insist on doing exercises and avoid wasting money on buying inappropriate equipment.<br><br></p>

  <h3>Define Problems</h3>
  <p>
    I often see people on the Internet leave messages under exercise videos saying that they want to become a better person through exercise. This better person may mean that they want to be physically better, mentally better, healthier, and look better. However, there is no denying that most people have no way to insist. I know from people around me that there are several reasons why they can't keep exercising.

      </ul>

  <h4>Result</h4>
  <p>While Doing the research, I started to think about what can solve their worried. How to design the app to solve the problem of the lack of time? What would be the cheapest way to get the best fittness result? How to motivate people to do exercises actively?

</p>
  <br><br><br>
  <h3>User research</h3>
  <h4>WHat are people thinking?</h4>
  <div class="image-sm">
    <img src="images/MindThinking.png" alt="">
  </div>
  <p>I researched people by asking the reason for giving up/insist and their perspective of Fittness app. Based on the information I gathered, I found that many people have a similar root reason. People told me they used to download the fitness app before, but after two or three times they did not use it. The fitness app indeed offers some professional videos for them to do exercises, but the problem is they cannot insist because of the human nature. Some people told me they don't know how to use the equipment in the gym or they are too shy to use it in public, so they just choose the treadmill which makes them finally think they waste the money to do something they could do free in neighborhood. Nicole, the girl who just graduate, said used to insist to follow the tutorial, but there might be still some incorrect move which causes the pain. One other college student said he used to go to gym with friends almost daily, however, he cannot find someone to do together now because of the more and more different schedules. Finally, he spend these time on games, even though he knows that is unhealthy.<br><br></p>
  <h3>HMW-How Might We?</h3>
  <div class="image-sm">
    <br><br><br>
    <img src="images/analysis.png" alt="">
  </div>
   <br>  <br>  <br>
    <p>After the research, I decide to use “HMW” methods to breakdown and assumpt what their insight, what their need, and how might we do. So that, I could decide what my FITT app would look like. Since many people said that the fittness app is useless because they don’t even do exercises. I realized that notify them how serious it would be if they do not exercises and motivate them to do exercises activiely is important. Based on the fittness lessons, the FITT app I decided would include the user health report and the leaderboard.

It is worth to tell the user that which level of their healthy problem is, and they could check their rank from the rank list to know if they have already doing appropriate exercises. Another design for solving the financial/equipment problem is the lesson settings and the online store. Like we mentioned above, many people only knows treadmill or they prefer not to use equipments. We should let the lessons not that “professional”, which means offer some lessons which is easy to understand. The equipments for starters should not be expensive and difficult. Also, shopping always be attractive. People should be easy to find the information of the appropriate equipments they should buy (system could recommend it by the user’s history class ).</p>
  <br><br><br><br>
  <h3>Design the user flow</h3>
  <p>Based on the research and define, I create the userflow of the FITT app's interaction. The 4 main interfaces would be: lessons, community, store, and account. The leaderboard would be shown in the account menu. <br><br></p>

  <h3>Storyboard</h3>
    <div class="image-md">

  </div>
  <p>Eric was a member of a gym. He passed by the gym every day on his way to work. After sitting in the office all morning, rubbing his sour eyes and shoulders, Eric remembered his expensive gym membership and decided to hit the gym after work. There wasn't much work in the afternoon, so he left work punctually and went to the gym. He noticed that the people there looked very well, and he began to worry that he was overweight. Eric knew he didn't have too much time to do exercise, so he started trying to lift weights, but his body couldn't handle. On the first day, he felt a little tired, but more of a sense of accomplishment. Eric feels that his life has become healthier. The next day, he went to the gym anyway and started thinking about buying some equipment at home because he was too shy to use it in public. On the third day, however, his arms and legs began to ache. So he decided to give himself a day off. The workload on the fourth day was too heavy, Eric had to work overtime to finish it. After work , Eric felt tired and hungry, and he eventrually chose to go straight home to sleep after work. In the days that followed, Eric never exercised again.

One day, he saw John, his colleague, using the FITT app to share his fitness leaderboard for the month. After registering and agreeing to share his location, Eric was surprised to find that his neighbor Megan were also using the app too. He began looking for the courses he was interested in. To be surprised, many of them were easy to do even in the office, some lessons only five to 10 minutes long and could be done between working time. It's not as stressful as going to the gym, and it's a great way to keep Eric from giving up. He began to use FITT app and sharing his fitness diary. A lot of people with similar background, or even his colleague chatted with him because they highly understanded his fitness path. Eric knew more friends and learned appropriate equipment knowledge, he began to be invited to go to the gym together at weekends by collegues. Eric gradually formed the habit of fitness, one day, he was surprised that he became the No.1 in the leaderboard, and received a small gift.

  <h3>Wireframe</h3>
  
  <p>Based on the userflow, I create the wireframe by balsamiq.Besides the basic function (lessons,community, store and account) and leaderboard, I also create the interface which collects user's fittness need and exercise level to better recommend apropriate lessons after they sign up.

  <p>
    The interactive wireframe is made as the rough prototype to test and improve before the high-fidelity prototype is designed.After testing, I found some UX problems exist in the wireframe, the first one is :the "forgot the password" and "set new one" are together in one page, that is too much for mobile users.

  <h3>Moving Forward</h3>
  <p>As a individual project, here is still a lot more to explore with Fitt, including the high-fidelity prototype. Besides, the questions like What if friends were be automatically added by the people nearby or the company's employee? What if Fitt's lessons were generated by users? Can we have more functions like timer and health test? These are just some of the questions I'd like to expand on as I continue to work on this project. I am still continuing the high-fidelity prototype, feel free to check out the current state of the app below. (If the image in prototype does not show up, please change the browser and try again.)</p>
